# Backend (Analytics Studio)
Install dependencies and run:
```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
This simple demo backend supports connecting to a MySQL server (ad-hoc) and returning tables/data.
It stores connections in memory (not secure) for demo purposes. Do NOT use this approach in production.
